# Claude Chat Branching Prototype - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This prototype demonstrates a revolutionary approach to AI chat interfaces through **branching conversations** - solving the core limitation of linear chat flows that disrupt ongoing conversations when users want to explore specific topics.

## Key Problem Solved
- **Current Issue**: AI chats are frustratingly linear. When users want to ask follow-up questions or explore tangents, they must either disrupt their main conversation flow, start entirely new conversations and lose context, or deal with cluttered, hard-to-navigate chat histories.
- **Solution**: Tree-structured conversations with seamless branching, maintaining context across all branches while keeping the interface clean and organized.

## Core Features
1. **Branch Creation**: One-click branching with auto-generated names based on conversation context
2. **Smart Navigation**: Breadcrumb trail and sidebar tree view for easy navigation
3. **Context Continuity**: All branches maintain access to parent conversation history
4. **Clean Organization**: Collapsible branches and hierarchical display

## Target Users
- Students for research & learning, multi-path exploration, comparison studies
- Researchers and developers for problem solving, alternative solutions, error recovery
- Knowledge workers for project management, feature discussions, technical decisions
